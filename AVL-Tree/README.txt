Implementation of:
- Binary Tree Traversal
- AVL Tree Insertion and Deletion

Program started by initializing an empty AVL tree. 
The program takes one line as input. 
The input line contains n "modification moves" separated by spaces. The available modification moves are:
- Aint (Character A followed by an int value between 1 and 100): A3 means insert value 3 into the AVL tree. If 3 is already in the tree, do nothing.
- Dint (Character D followed by an int value between 1 and 100): D3 means delete value 3 into the AVL tree. If 3 is not in the tree, do nothing.
Your input is then followed by exactly one finishing move (PRE or POST or IN): If the finishing move is PRE, then you should print out the tree (in its current situation) in pre-order. If the tree is empty, print out
EMPTY. Otherwise, print out the values separated by spaces. POST and IN are handled similarly.

Sample input 1: A1 A2 A3 IN
Sample output 1: 1 2 3
Sample input 2: A1 A2 A3 PRE
Sample output 2: 2 1 3
Sample input 3: A1 D1 POST
Sample output 3: EMPTY
